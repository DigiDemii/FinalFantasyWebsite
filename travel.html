        <q>A breed of flightless birds, characterized by their yellow feathers, distinct odor, and the unforgettable chirp, "kweh!" Domesticated for their gentle nature and quick feet, they are often used as a mode of ground transportation.</q>

    <p class="text">Chocobo [ˈtʃoʊ.kɵˌboʊ], also called Chocob, is a recurring animal in the series. Large avian creatures, chocobos roughly act as the Final Fantasy equivalent of horses, being domesticated for use as mounts, for pulling carts and carriages and for racing. Since their first appearance in Final Fantasy II, they have appeared in every game in the series in some capacity. As a mainstay they could be considered the series's mascot.</p>

    <h2 class="titleback">Fahrenheit Airship</h2>

    <img class="characters" src="/images/airship.jpeg" alt="An airship from Final Fantasy X">

    <p class="text">The Fahrenheit, also known as the Continental Circus in the Final Fantasy Mechanical Arts depiction of the airship (action figure), is the airship available to the player in Final Fantasy X. Unlike in previous Final Fantasy installments, there is no world map overview, and the player cannot manually fly the ship around Spira. Instead, it is used for quickly transporting from one location to another.</p>

    <p class="text">The text "Wind bless you" is inscribed on the gold dial in Al Bhed script. The writing on the deck of the ship says "Salvage Dream CID". During the battle against Evrae that takes place on the airship's deck, Trigger Commands are available to move the airship away from the fiend.</p>
